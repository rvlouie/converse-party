            <p>As a friend of Converse Rubber Tracks and Indaba Music, we’d like to invite you to a special party at Rubber Tracks Studio in Brooklyn on Wednesday, May 28, to kick off an exciting new initiative.</p><p>As you know, Rubber Tracks is a community based studio in Brooklyn NYC where musicians record for free every day. Converse is working with Indaba Music on an exciting project to bring the Rubber Tracks experience online. In the community spirit of Rubber Tracks, Converse and Indaba will take musician-approved samples and loops recorded at Rubber Tracks to create a free, online sound library for independent artists. This project will benefit musicians around the world and foster an environment of artistic collaboration and creation.</p><p>Upon its launch later this summer, the online sound library will feature thousands of free samples and loops donated by talented musicians who have recorded at Rubber Tracks. Musicians around the world will be able to browse the sound library and download samples to use in their own projects. The idea is to foster a positive, collaborative environment where musicians are helping other musicians in a free and open way.</p><p>Rubber Tracks is opening its doors to two-days of sample recording on May 27th and May 28th to create the core group of sounds that will launch with the library. As a friend of Rubber Tracks, we'd like to invite you to a party from 7:00pm to 10:00pm on Wednesday, May 28th to kick off the creation of the sample library. The party will feature food, drink, music, and good times.</p><p>Please RSVP using the form below. See you there! </p><h1>Converse Rubber Tracks and Indaba Music</h1>
